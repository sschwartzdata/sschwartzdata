- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @sschwartzdata.

- Iâ€™m interested in expanding and displaying my data analysis skills. 

- When I am not working on my data analysis skills I enjoy knitting, reading and hiking.

- Iâ€™m currently learning python data analysis packages pandas, Numpy, SciPy and Matplolib. I am also currently expanding my knowlegde of SQL and R.
