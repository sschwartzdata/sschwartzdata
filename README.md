- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @sschwartzdata.

- Iâ€™m interested in expanding and displaying my data analysis skills. 

- When I am not working on my data analysis skills I enjoy knitting, reading and hiking.

- I am currently exploring the field of Data Science and have a particular interest in Machine Learning.
